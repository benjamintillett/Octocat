Git clone when passed a link to a git repo as an argument will clone the repo into your current working directory

Git will then:

	- make a directory with the same name as the the repo (unless otherwize specified)

	- cd into the new directory

	- initialize a new git repository

	- add the remote origin and point it to the url of the repository you are cloneing from

	- fetch the current state of the origins master branch and point you master to the same commit

	- merged the changes into you CWD

	- and finally cd in to the directory you issued the git clone command from
